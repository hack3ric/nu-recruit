# NU Recruit

My entry to 2021 UESTC NetUnion recruit.

## Prerequisition

- Sendmail properly set up (I still haven't figure it out, but it should work just fine if you do so)
- Node.js v16

## Getting Started

First, set up your email addresses in `.env`:
```env
FROM_EMAIL=foo@example.com
TO_EMAIL=bar@example.com
```

And then, build and run:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
